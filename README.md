# JLPT Flashcard

very early stage project

This is a really small project with the aim to create a simple web interface for a basic flashcard system about jplt words from N5 to N1.
The idea is to have few functionality, an organized dataset and fast interaction, ideal as a shortcut on mobile phones.

Built with react and vite.
